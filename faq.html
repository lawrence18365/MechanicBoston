                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We don't set prices—each shop in our network determines their own rates based on their costs, expertise, and market conditions. By getting multiple quotes, you can compare pricing, warranty terms, and turnaround times to find the best value. Our partner shops typically offer competitive pricing, often 15-30% below dealership rates.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The quotes you receive are based on the information you provide and the shop's experience with similar repairs. For standard maintenance and common repairs, quotes are typically very accurate. For complex issues that may require diagnosis, shops will provide their best estimate based on the symptoms you describe, with the understanding that the final price may change once they inspect your vehicle. Our partner shops commit to transparency and will always discuss any potential price changes before proceeding with work.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>You always pay the repair shop directly. MechanicBoston never collects payment for repair services. This ensures a direct relationship between you and the shop for all service and warranty matters.</p>

                        <p>Many shops in our network offer financing options for larger repairs, typically through third-party providers like Synchrony or Affirm. When you receive quotes, shops will indicate if they offer financing options. You can also specify in your request if financing is important to you.</p>
